    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Linguists working in a variety of subfields (sociolinguistics, phonetics, language documentation, etc.) often require high-quality time-aligned transcripts of speech recordings. Transcription typically involves two separate processes: (1) identifying and marking off the segments of the recording that contain speech (vs. silence), and (2) transcribing each of the speech segments. When multiple people are speaking in the recording, as is the case for interviews, these two processes are carried out on a separate tier for each speaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improvements in automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology have enabled researchers to segment and transcribe their recordings with commercial and open-source software tools. However, there are many cases in which ASR is either unavailable (e.g., for most minority languages) or not reliable enough for research applications. In these situations, researchers often carry out the entire workflow—both segmentation and transcription—by hand. Figuring out a way to automate even a small part of this workflow could save researchers a great deal of time, effort, and money.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides instructions on the use of open-source software for **speaker diarization**: the task of determining *who* is speaking *when* and marking off these segments with timestamps. The tutorial assumes that the user has a set of audio recordings with two speakers, e.g., from sociolinguistic interviews, and wishes to transcribe each speaker on a separate tier in a program such as ELAN or Praat. We piloted these steps as part of the transcription workflow for the [Corpus of Spoken Yiddish in Europe](https://www.yiddishcorpus.org), but your recordings can be in any spoken language. The number of speakers and other parameters can also be modified below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial is written in Python and can be followed on a personal or cluster computer, assuming you have [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed. The tutorial relies on the speaker diarization toolkit and pretrained pipeline distributed through [pyannote](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio) ([Bredin et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP40776.2020.9052974); [Bredin & Laurent 2021](https://doi.org/10.21437/Interspeech.2021-560)). Diarization is computationally intensive, and so for best results we recommend using a GPU device. If you would like to test this process on your own speech recordings without needing to install any software locally, we have also put together [an interactive Google Colab notebook](link) that can be executed in the browser with a GPU runtime. \n",

    "## Prepare and diarize the audio files\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will prepare a set of audio files for diarization and then run a diarization pipeline on them to produce annotation files: either `.eaf` for use with [ELAN](https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan) or `.TextGrid` for use with [Praat](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/), according to your needs. The workflow produces speaker tiers in the annotation files that contain intervals marking locations in the audio where that speaker is talking.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, we initially designed this workflow to diarize interviews for the [Corpus of Spoken Yiddish in Europe](https://www.yiddishcorpus.org). The source audio for that project consists of stereo files, where each speaker was recorded on a separate lapel microphone and could thus be heard predominantly on either the left or right channel. However, there was also substantial [\"bleed\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spill_(audio)) across the channels because the speakers were sitting near each other in the same room. The approach we found to work best was to diarize the left and right channels separately; this resulted in four \"speaker\" tiers, two for the interviewer (left and right) and two for the subject (left and right). We then calculated the average duration of speech on each tier to determine which two to label as the \"interviewer\" and which two to label as the \"subject\"; for each speaker, we further compared the mean intensity of the two channels in order to guess which tier (left or right) was likely to be more reliable. The resulting `.eaf` file thus contained four tiers, labeled \"Interviewer probable,\" \"Interviewer unlikely,\" \"Subject probable,\" and \"Subject unlikely.\" Our transcribers would then open the files in ELAN, verify that the \"probable\" tiers have reasonable segments (or else use the \"unlikely\" tiers), and begin transcription.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the workflow we adopt in this tutorial, though it can be modified to accommodate other kinds of speech recordings. Each step is designed to be easily repeated whenever new inputs to the step are added to the project. For step 1, this would be when new source audio files are added. Step 2 should be run whenever newly prepared audio files (i.e., from step 1) become available. Step 3 combines the diarized outputs (in the case of stereo files) into a single `.eaf` or `.TextGrid` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Step 1: Prepare audio](#step-1): Loop over every source audio file, extract the left/right channels (if stereo), and downsample the audio.\n",
    "* [Step 2: Diarize the prepared audio](#step-2): Run the speaker diarization pipeline on each downsampled mono audio file.\n",
    "* [Step 3: Combine diarized outputs](#step-3): For stereo recordings, combine the diarized outputs into a single `.eaf` or `.TextGrid` file."

In other words, a silence needs to be >0.582 seconds before it is treated as a pause boundary between speech segments.
